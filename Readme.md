###### Infinity complexes as a natural byproduct when defined within QCD. Generate sub-linear scattering. 

#### Lambda Field Encoding : Implies that these sub-linear scatterings
###### Are encoding channels, bound to electrical resistance. Since we use scientific notation to define space and time, wave theorems.
